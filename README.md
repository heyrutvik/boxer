## Boxer: a demo scalac plugin, embedded in your SBT project.

Ever wish you could inject some extra analysis into the
compiler pipeline for your project? You could write a compiler
plugin, package, distribute it, and depend on it, but the
activation energy for that is pretty high.

`Boxer` shows you how to embed a custom compiler plugin
directly into a sub-project of your SBT project. With this
in place, you can edit the plugin, run compile, and *immediately*
see the results in the context of your project.

### What's inside

 - [SBT Project Definition](https://github.com/retronym/boxer/blob/master/project/build.scala)
 - Compiler Plugin [Descriptor](https://github.com/retronym/boxer/blob/master/plugin/src/main/resources/scalac-plugin.xml) and
[Sources](https://github.com/retronym/boxer/blob/master/plugin/src/main/scala/demo/DemoPlugin.scala)

The Scala version used is 2.12.x, but the same code also works in
2.11.x.
